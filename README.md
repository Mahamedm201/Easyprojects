# Easyprojects 

Hello and welcome to my repository.
I created this repository to track my progress as I learn Java.
There are three projects that I created while learning the syntax of java.
  - Coffee machine
    the project imatates an actual coffee shop
  - Simple chat bot
    this project illustartes a basic chat bot
  - tic tac toe
    this project is a two player game where each player enters a 2D coordinates from 1 to 3 inclusive. X starts first.
Although they are not perfect or super concise language wise, however it made me learn and appreciate java.
Enjoy!
